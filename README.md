## Coding Project — Next.js “Button Counter” (React)
Overview

I built a small Next.js web app that renders a reusable Button Counter component. This project implements stateful React UI with accessible controls.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
